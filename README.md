## Pipelines

### Data aquisition pipeline

This pipeline is located at [/src/aluminium_prediction/pipelines/aquisition](https://github.com/KKobuszewski/aluminium-prediction/tree/main/src/aluminium_prediction/pipelines/aquisition).

Aquisition pipeline collects data scraping them from websites or utilizing certain APIs.

Dataset for aluminium (LME cash) are collected from:

* [www.investing.com/](https://www.investing.com/commodities/aluminum-historical-data)

* [www.westmetall.com](https://www.westmetall.com/en/markdaten.php?action=table&field=LME_Al_cash)

* [metals-api.com](https://metals-api.com/documentation)

* [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com)



## Potential issues

1. Too small dataset
    * In [this article](https://medium.com/@mskmay66/transformers-vs-lstm-for-stock-price-time-series-prediction-3a26fcc1a782) LSTMs with ~200.000 nodes and transformers with ~20.000 are trained, while we can use data from 2000-4000 days.
    * Probably more than one variable should be considered (not only aluminium prices).
