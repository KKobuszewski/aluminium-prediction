# aluminium-prediction

## Overview

This project is generated by [Kedro](https://docs.kedro.org) with Kedro-Viz setup, which was generated using `kedro 0.19.4`.

Take a look at the hints in [readme/Kedro.md](https://github.com/KKobuszewski/aluminium-prediction/blob/main/readme/Kedro.md)

## Pipelines

### Data aquisition pipeline

This pipeline is located at [/src/aluminium_prediction/pipelines/aquisition](https://github.com/KKobuszewski/aluminium-prediction/tree/main/src/aluminium_prediction/pipelines/aquisition).

Aquisition pipeline collects data scraping them from websites or utilizing certain APIs.

Datasets for **aluminium prices**[^1] are collected from:

* [www.investing.com/](https://www.investing.com/commodities/aluminum-historical-data)

* [www.westmetall.com](https://www.westmetall.com/en/markdaten.php?action=table&field=LME_Al_cash)

* [metals-api.com](https://metals-api.com/documentation)

* [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com)


[^1]: In the beginig I am going to focus on [LME cash price](https://www.lme.com/en/Metals/Non-ferrous/LME-Aluminium#Summary), probably 1-,2-,3- month contracts can be considered in the future.

**Aluminium production**

USD/EUR 

Indicators of consumption???

Indicators of trade???


### Transfer entropy

## Potential issues

1. Too small dataset
    * In [this article](https://medium.com/@mskmay66/transformers-vs-lstm-for-stock-price-time-series-prediction-3a26fcc1a782) LSTMs with ~200.000 parameters and transformers with ~20.000 parameters are trained, while we can use data from 2000-4000 days.
    * Probably more than one variable should be considered (not only aluminium prices). <---- Dimensionality reduction? Autoencoder? PCA? [Granger Causality Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality)? [**Transfer Entropy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy)?
    * Transformer NN demand less parameters in comparison with LSTM. Some convolution layers can also improve performance (see [here](https://medium.com/@mskmay66/deep-learning-and-stock-time-series-data-ff6a75cfddd9)).
    * As we can have data from different sources (which sligthly differ) we can produce multiple different time series
